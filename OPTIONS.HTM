<BR>The Net Link web browser contains many different configuration options,
each of which you can reach from either the Toolbar Icon or the Command
Cluster Icon.  You will want to utilize these options to enter personal
information essential to accessing an Internet account, along with instructions
for changing the look of the on-screen icons, cursors and Net Link sound
effects.
<P>After choosing the <I>Options</I> Icon, you will need to choose what
Options you wish to view and change:
<P>Select one of the <I>Options</I> categories or <B>press &quot;Save&quot;
to store all of your Option adjustments</B>.  Select the category with the
A Button (or Left Button if you're using a Mouse).  You'll then see one
of the displays described below.  To exit these displays, press the START
Button.  If you want <B>to exit the Options menu without saving any changes,
press the START Button</B>.  And don't forget to press the <B><I>Save</I></B>
button to make sure your changes are saved.<P>

<BR>
The <I>General Options</I> screen contains information about your Internet
Account, and your audio/visual preferences when Browsing the Web.
<P><B>User Login</B>:  Your account name.  For example, when using Mplayer
Internet Service, your account <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Login">login</A> will appear something like this: ss/000011.  This
name is different from your <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#E-mail">e-mail</A> name, which would be something like this:
 ken@netlink.xband.com.  (Please see
Mail Options below.)  If you have a different <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">ISP</A>, this name may be some
variation of your account name  (ex. Netcom would use #ken.)
<P><B>Password</B>:  Your account <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Password">password</A> is needed to access the Internet.
 You should guard this carefully to prevent abuse of your account.  If you
change your password, be sure to change your mail password as well - we
recommend that the two passwords be the same. 
<P><B>Parental Control</B>:  The current status of the <A HREF="file://parental.htm">Parental Control</A>
system.  If this says "Not Registered", you are not being protected.
<P><B>Show Titlebar</B>:  Turns the display of the title of the Web page
on and off, giving you more screen space to see Web pages. 
<P><B>Show Toolbar</B>:  Turning this off will eliminate the Toolbar Icons
at the top of the screen.  You can access most of these through Command
Cluster by pressing the START button.  
<P><B>Sticky Keys</B>:  Make your Arrow jump from key to key on the on-screen
keyboard.  This can make typing with the on-screen keyboard easier, as your
Arrow automatically &quot;sticks&quot; to the keys.
<P><B>Always Hide Keyboard</B>:  Turns the virtual on-screen keyboard on
and off when you select a field to enter text.  Only use this option if
you have a keyboard attached to your Sega Saturn.
<P><B>Sound Effects</B>:  Turns the sounds associated with each action in
the Browser on and off.
<P><B>Screen Saver</B>:  Turns the <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Screen Saver">screen saver</A> on and off. In the event
that you leave the Browser unattended for several minutes, the screen will
switch to a moving star field.  This is to prevent &quot;screen burn&quot;
or permanent marks on your television.  To return to the normal display,
just press any button on the Sega Saturn Controller or Mouse.
<P>
<P><B><A NAME="network">Network Preferences</A></B>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="file://netopt.jpeg" WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=131 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="netopt">
<BR>
The Network Options screen contains details of your telephone and network
connection to the Internet, including all telephone dialing information
to phone your ISP.
<P><B>Area Code</B>: Enter your area code here.
<P><B>ISP Phone 1 and 2</B>: The phone number (s) of the local connection
to your ISP go here.  Enter both numbers, so if one is busy the Browser
will automatically try the second.  If you only have one number, leave the
second blank.
<P>Modem Init:  The Net Link <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Modem Initialization">modem initialization</A> commands go here, along
with default to: AT&amp;D2&amp;K3&amp;Q0.  You do not need to change this
from the default.
<P><B>DNS 1 and 2</B>:  Each ISP will have one or two <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#DNS">Domain Name Servers</A>
(DNS ).  These are normally represented by four numbers separated by periods.
 Sometimes your <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">ISP</A> will automatically send these when you connect.  If
your ISP specifies DNS, fill them in.  If you are not able to connect to
any sites on the Internet - especially if you continually receive a message
saying the server cannot be found - you probably need to enter the DNS values.
If you use another ISP, other than Mplayer Internet Service,  you will need to get these two numbers from their
customer service support or documentation.
<P><B>Long Distance</B>: This is where you enter the access code for long
distance service (for example 1,).
<P><B>Call Waiting</B>:  If your phone has Call Waiting and another call
comes in while you're using Net Link, it will cause you to be disconnected
from the Internet.  Check this box to disable Call Waiting while you're
using the Internet.
<P><B>Outside Line</B>:  Enter here the access code for getting an outside
phone line (for example 9). Normally this will only apply if you are dialing
out from a PBX.
<P><B>Tone Dial</B>:  Most modern phone systems use tone dialing, which
is much faster than rotary dialing.  If your phone system needs rotary,
or pulse, dialing, un-check this button.
<P><B>Dial Area Code</B>:  Check to have the area code dialed each time
you log on.  This is necessary if your ISP access number is a long distance
call. 
<P><B>Blind Dial</B>: Check this box to have the modem dial without detecting
a dial tone.  If your phone's dial tone is not normal (due to being inside
a PBX, or if you have phone mail that changes the dial tone), your modem
may not be able to detect the dial tone.

<BR>
The Mail screen contains everything you need to send and receive e-mail:
<P><B>Real Name</B>:  Your real name.  Mail that you send will show this
name as the sender.
<P><B>Mail Login</B>:  Your e-mail account <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Login">login</A> goes here. If you are using
Mplayer Internet Service, your e-mail address may be different from your account name.
<P><B>Mail Password</B>:  Displays the <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Password">password</A> for accessing your e-mail
mailbox at the electronic Post Office. If you're not using Mplayer Internet Service,
make sure that you change this password to be consistent with the password
under General Options.
<P><B>E-mail Return Address</B>:  Displays your actual electronic <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Return Address">mail address</A>
that other people use to reach you.  The Net Link web browser also uses
this address to know where to find your mailbox. If you are using Mplayer Internet Service, your e-mail address should look something like: ken@netlink.xband.com
<P><B>Pop3 Server</B>:  Displays the <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#POP3">POP3</A> server (the name of your ISP's
incoming e-mail server). If you are using Mplayer Internet Service, this should
look like: mail.xband.com
<P><B>SMTP Server</B>:  The <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#SMTP">SMTP</A> server is the name of your ISP's outgoing
e-mail server address.  If you are using Mplayer Internet Service, it will look
something like this: mail.xband.com
<P><B>Quote Original Message</B>:  Check this box to include the original
letter in any reply answering that letter.  The original will appear quoted
to offset it from the reply.
<P><B>Show Headers</B>:  Check this box to display the complete, complex
mailing information detailing how a letter found its way across the Internet
to you
<P>
<P><B><A NAME="themes">Themes</A></B>
<BR><IMG SRC="file://themes.jpeg" WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=131 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="themes">
<BR>
Here you can change the look of the icons, cursors, and the sounds associated
with actions.  The following is a brief description of each Theme option:
<P><B>Far East</B>:  An oriental theme of the ancient variety.
<P><B>Metalico</B>:  A  metal worker's dream.  Very industrial.
<P><B>Sports</B>:  Whether you like golf, baseball or football, you'll have
a ball with this theme.
<P><B>Urbanite</B>:  This urban theme is lots of fun, from the graffiti
to the traffic cones.
<P><B>Rocketman</B>:  A science fiction extravaganza.  Spaceward bound! 
<P><B>School Daze</B>:  No more pencils, no more books, just a few teacher's dirty looks!
<P><B>Bob's Delite</B>:  A soothing Japanese theme.
<P><B>Default</B>:  A good, simple colorful theme.
<P>
<P><B><A NAME="time">Time Zone</A></B>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="file://timezone.jpeg" WIDTH=265 HEIGHT=130 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="timezone">
<BR>
Here you can choose the time zone from which you wish to run your Internet
account. To choose a time zone, click the Time Zone bubble at the bottom
of the screen, then select your time zone. (However, the time should already
be set on your Sega Saturn base unit.)
