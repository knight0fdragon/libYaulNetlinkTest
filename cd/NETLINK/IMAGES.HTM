You don't need to know what kind of picture is coming fromthe Web - your Net Link will automatically determine the format and displayit properly. You can view these kinds of images inside of Web pages, andyou can view these images by themselves. Images up to approximately 400kBytes in size can be displayed.</P><BR><IMG SRC="file://sound.jpeg" WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=268 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="sound"><BR><P>You can also listen to audio (sound) files that were recorded in severaldifferent standard formats, including <A HREF="file://glossary.html#WAV">WAV</A> (a Windows format), <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#AIFF">AIFF</A> (a Macintoshformat), and <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#AU">AU</A> (a UNIX format).  As with pictures, you don't need to knowwhat kind of format the audio file was recorded in - your Net Link willautomatically determine the format and play it properly. When you selectone of these audio files, the progress bar on the lower left will show youthe completion percentage -- sometimes audio files can be quite large andtake a long time to download.  You can listen to audio files of up to approximately400 kBytes in size.</P><BR><BR><P>Once the audio file has been loaded, you can Play, Fast Forward, FastRewind, Stop, and Pause the sound file from the Audio Control Panel.
