<P>In order to access the World Wide Web and use Electronic Mail, you will
need an account with an <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">Internet Service Provider</A> (ISP).  After you load
the Net Link web browser for the first time, you will be taken through the
account registration process.  Have a valid credit card handy and follow
the on-screen directions to make sure that all necessary information is
recorded properly.</P>

<LI>
<P>The web browser will automatically take you to the registration process.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Click on &quot;Yes&quot; when asked if you would like to sign up with
Mplayer Internet Service.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>To enter information in an available entry space, simply move your cursor
with the D-pad on the <A HREF="file://pad.htm">Sega Saturn controller</A> over the desired entry space
and push the A Button.  An on-screen keyboard will appear; move the cursor
and select the desired characters by pushing the A Button on the Sega Saturn
controller.  As you select letters, you will see them appear in the selected
entry space.  If you make a mistake, click on the left facing arrow on the
on-screen keyboard to erase the last character.  Click on the &quot;Enter&quot;
button when you are finished typing in characters for the selected entry
space.  Using the Z button on the controller will automatically advance
you through the entry spaces.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Continue selecting entry spaces and entering your information until you
have filled in all the necessary spaces.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<P>When you are finished, your Sega Saturn's memory will automatically be
updated will all necessary information so you will not have to reenter it
all again.  However, we strongly recommend writing down all pertinent information
in case your Sega Saturn's internal RAM is accidentally erased.  Select
<A HREF="file://options.html">&quot;Options&quot;</A> from the <A HREF="file://main.htm#toolbar">Toolbar</A> and then select &quot;General Preferences,&quot;
&quot;Network Preferences,&quot; and &quot;Mail Preferences&quot; to bring
up the information you should record in the manual.</P>
<P>Your credit card will be billed on a monthly basis.  To cancel an account with Mplayer Internet Service, you will need
to call their customer support center by telephone at (415)429-3100.</P>
<BR>
<P>When you connect to the Internet, you will see a green box labelled &quot;Modem
Messages&quot; appear.  This is normal; the characters that appear are standard
modem commands and will be used by yourself and Sega customer service to
determine if your modem is dialing properly and connecting to your Internet
Service Provider.  Once connected, this box will disappear.</P>
<BR>
<P>On your first connection to the Internet, you will see a  simple instruction
page on how to use the Net Link web browser and Net Link City interface.
 Please review this page carefully; if you have questions after seeing this
page, please refer to this manual.</P>
