<P>You can send and receive e-mail from your Net Link web browser with most

<A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">ISPs</A> including Mplayer Internet Service.  There are no additional fees

to send or receive e-mail beyond your normal connect charges. However, check

with your ISP for possible e-mail charges. (All you'll pay is your monthly

fees to your service provider; there's no per-message charges.) To access,

choose the Mail Icon from the Toolbar or the Command Cluster. </P>

 on the left edge of the page.  You can view a message by clicking on the

highlighted subject line.</P>

<BR>

<P>Once the letter has been retrieved from your mail box, you will see the

body of the letter and you can scroll down to read the entire message. At

the top of the letter is a row of Action buttons so that you can respond

to the letter. Click on the desired button to perform an action, or use

the Back Icon to return to the Post Office.</P>
