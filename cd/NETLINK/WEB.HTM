<P><B><A NAME="What is the Internet">What is the Internet?</A></B></P>
<BR>
<P>The <I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Internet">Internet</A></I> is, essentially, a giant network connecting tens
of thousands of computers around the world.  Each computer on the Internet
uses a special standard language to send information so that any other computer
on the Internet can understand the message.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><A NAME="What is the World Wide Web">What is the World Wide Web?</A></B></P>
<BR>
<P>The <I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#World Wide Web">World Wide Web</A></I>
(WWW) is a subset of the Internet.  The &quot;<I>Web</I>&quot;
consists of thousands of <I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Web Server">web servers</A></I> (computers that send information)
that use a special language (<I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#HTTP">hypertext transport protocol</A></I> or http
for short) to send graphics, text and sounds that can be displayed and listened
to on-screen by any computer connected to the Internet using a special software
program called a web browser. These graphics and text are organized into
pages and often appear on the computer screen resembling a magazine or book
page. With your Net Link, of course, you will see these pages on your television
screen.</P>
<BR>
<P>Each web page on the Internet has a unique identifying address (called
a <I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#URL">Universal Resource Locator</A></I> or URL for short) that you can enter
into your Net Link web browser in order to access that page directly.  In
addition, most Web pages on the Internet have links that connect them to
other Web pages.  By clicking on a link, your Net Link web browser by <A HREF="http://www.planetweb.com/">PlanetWeb</A>
will automatically take you to the connected Web page.  If you find a Web
page that is particularly interesting, you can save its URL (identifying
address) in the Net Link web browser's &quot;<I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Bookmark">Bookmark List</A></I>&quot;.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><A NAME="How do Web pages get to me">How do Web pages get to me</A>?</B></P>
<BR>
<P>The words, sounds and images on a web page travel from that page's Web
Server over the Internet to your <I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">Internet Service Provider</A></I>. They
 then travel from your Internet Service Provider through your phone line
to your Net Link <I><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Modem">modem</A></I> - and into your Sega Saturn. Your Net Link
modem can process 28,800 bits of data per second, as fast or faster than
nearly all personal computer modems!</P>
<BR>
<P>Since graphic images contain more data than simple text, pictures take
longer to send through the Internet.  Complex and/or large images take more
time to send than small pictures.  Your Net Link web browser has been specifically
designed to load the text on a page first so you can start reading while
the graphics are still arriving.</P>
<BR>
<P>Another thing to remember is that there are hundreds of thousands of
computers on the Internet and there may be many people using it at any particular
time. Just like during rush hour on a freeway, sometimes there are traffic
jams on the Internet and your data comes to you more slowly.  Your Net Link
web browser software has been designed to work very efficiently with the
Internet to ensure that your data is transferred as quickly as current traffic
conditions permit.  If the Internet seems extremely slow, you may want to
try a different Web page or connect again later.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><A NAME="How Much Does It Cost To Use the Web">How Much Does It Cost To Use the Web</A>?</B></P>
<BR>
<P>Unlike your phone (which costs you different amounts to make calls depending
on the distance), you can use your Net Link and the Internet to visit any
Web Page in the world for the same price.  For example, you can access a
Web page in Paris, France for the same price as accessing a Web Page next
door.  You only pay for access time from your <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">Internet Service Provider</A>
and, possibly, any additional phone charges needed to connect to your Internet
Service Provider's access point.</P>
<BR>
<P>Sega has teamed up with Mplayer Internet Service to provide a reasonably priced plan

offering access to the Internet -- unlimited usage for a single monthly

fee. Please check Sega's NetLink web page or call Mplayer Internet Service at

415-429-3100 for the latest rates.</p><p>MISP has a nationwide phone network with access points across the

United States so there is a very good chance that a Mplayer Internet Service connection

will be a local call.  However, local access (i.e. a local, toll-free

call) is not necessarily available in all areas.</p>
<BR>
<P>Your Net Link <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#Modem">modem</A> and browser software are also compatible with most
major <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">Internet Service Providers</A> (ISP) so you should be able to use an existing
PPP Internet account, if you have one. Please see &quot;<A HREF="file://alternate.htm">Using an Alternate
Service Provider</A>&quot;.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><A NAME="What Is Electronic Mail">What Is Electronic Mail</A>?</B></P>
<BR>
<P><A HREF="file://glossary.htm#E-mail">Electronic Mail</A> (e-mail) messages are letters that you send and receive
over the Internet.  Sending and receiving e-mail using your Net Link web
browser is even easier than writing a letter and putting it in the mail
box--you don't need envelopes or stamps!  Your unique Internet address -
like your home or office address - enables other people to send you electronic
mail.  If you're using Mplayer Internet Service, there are no additional charges
for sending and receiving e-mail.  (See the <A HREF="file://mail.htm">Electronic Mail section</A> for
details.) If you are using a different <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">ISP</A>, it may have different payment
plans so check with your provider for any possible e-mail charges.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><A NAME="What Is Parental Control">What Is Internet Filtering</A>?</B></P>
<BR>
<P>The Internet is a very large community and like any large community,
there are places that are inappropriate for children.  The Net Link web
browser gives parents the option of &quot;filtering&quot; what their family
accesses from the Internet.  Because opinions of what is inappropriate vary
from person to person, Net Link web browser's Parental Control can be
customized.  When you sign up with Mplayer Internet Service you will be able to
automatically sign up for Parental Control for a 6 month free trial. 
If you use another Internet Service Provider, you can sign up through Net
Link web browser's Internet site, also for a free trial. Keep checking the
Net Link web browser's on-line &quot;what's new&quot; area  for the most
up-to-date Filtering information at <A HREF="http://www.sega.com/netlink/">http://www.sega.com/netlink/</A>.
 (See the <A HREF="file://parental.htm">Parental Control</A> section for details.)</P>

<P><B><A NAME="The Future of the Net Link Web Browser">The Future of the Net Link Web Browser</A></B></P>
<BR>
<P>The World Wide Web is constantly improving and the content and features
of what appears on the Web get better and better.  In order to
take advantage of these improvements, you may want to obtain upgraded revisions
of your Net Link web browser.</P>
<BR>
<P>Connect to  <A HREF="http://www.sega.com/netlink/">http://www.sega.com/netlink/</A>
to access the Net Link on-line newsletter for the latest news on browser
updates.  You will be able to download certain upgrades of the browser into
your Sega Saturn at no cost. Direct your
Web Browser to the <A HREF="http://www.sega.com/netlink/">http://www.sega.com/netlink/</A>
 location and follow the instructions to receive the latest version of the
Net Link web browser.  The download procedure will take several minutes
to complete.  For on-line upgrades, you will need to repeat this procedure every time you turn
on Net Link if you wish to continue using the latest on-line revisions.  You may also decide
to purchase an upgraded <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#CD">CD</A> to obtain new features or for convenience.</P>
