To install, plug the KeyboardAdapter into your Sega Saturn right controller port and then plug your PCkeyboard into the connector. You can use either a 101-key keyboard or an84-key keyboard.</P><BR><P>If your PC keyboard does not have a small plug (mini-DIN) PC compatibleconnector, you will need to purchase a special converter. You can purchasethis adapter, if needed, from most major computer retailers.</P><BR><P>Once you've connected the keyboard and adapter you can type as you normallywould on a computer. If you are using an 84-key keyboard, however, you willnot have access to some of the special &quot;quick&quot; keys listed below.</P><BR><P>Use the keyboard to type character, change or enter a URL, write andsend e-mail and enter searches on the Web. Some keys on the keyboard canact as special Quick-Keys that perform an action quickly. The followingis a list of the Quick-Keys you can use:</P><UL><LI><P><B>ENTER</B> Takes you to the Web page designated by the URL bar.</P></LI><LI><P><B>ESC</B> Deletes the contents of the selected entry.</P></LI><LI><P><B>F1-F3</B> The same as the three buttons on the right of the on-screenkeyboard.  (Using the Shift key with any of these keys affects them thesame as the on-screen keyboard.)</P></LI><LI><P><B>F4</B> Same as the START key.  Causes the on-screen keyboard to be put away.</LI></UL><BR><P>If you are using the keyboard adapter and notice that your Sega Saturnis not accepting input from the keyboard, do not be alarmed. Simply unplugthe keyboard adapter from your Sega Saturn, wait a few seconds and plugit back in. Wait a few more seconds. Do not press the &quot;Reset&quot;button on your Sega Saturn while holding down any key on a keyboard attachedto the keyboard adapter. This will prevent your Sega Saturn from being ableto access your keyboard. Again, if your Sega Saturn has problens accessingthe keyboard, simply unplug your keyboard adapter from your Sega Saturn,wait a few seconds and plug it back in and wait a few more seconds. Youshould then be able to type normally.</P><HR><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="file://pad.htm"><IMG SRC="file://back.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="28"></A></TD><TD><A HREF="file://contents.htm"><IMG SRC="file://top.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="28"></A></TD><TD><A HREF="file://main.htm"><IMG SRC="file://next.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="28"></A></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
