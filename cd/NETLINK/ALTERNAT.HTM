<BR>
<P>If you already have a PPP-capable account with another <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#ISP">service provider</A>,
you can probably use that existing account instead of signing up with Mplayer Internet Service.  </P>
<BR>
<P>During the registration process (which will automatically start the first
time you load your Net Link web browser), you will be asked whether you
would like to sign up with Mplayer Internet Service.  Scroll to the bottom of
the page and click on the &quot;No&quot; button.</P>
<BR>
<P>You will then see a screen detailing all the information you will need
to obtain from your Internet Service Provider.  This information is also
detailed in the <A HREF="file://options.htm">Options</A> section.  We strongly recomment that you record
all this information so that you can refer to it in case you accidentally
clear your Sega Saturn's internal RAM.</P>
<BR>
<P>Once you have all the necessary information, click on the &quot;Next&quot;
button.</P>
<BR>
<P>The next several screens will ask you to enter all the necessary information.
 Please refer to the previous section for instructions on how to enter information
into the entry blanks.  When you have filled in all entry blanks on each
screen, click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button to proceed to the next screen.</P>
<BR>
<P>You will be asked to confirm all information that you have entered. 
Please carefully review to make sure that you did not make any mistakes
while entering your information.  Remember that your Sega Saturn considers
lower-cased and upper-cased letters to be different--make sure that you
used the proper case.  When you are sure that all information is correct,
click on the &quot;Correct&quot; button.</P>
<BR>
<P>You are now ready to connect to the Internet.  Click on the &quot;Connect&quot;
button to start your first Internet session.</P>
<BR>
<P>You will see a green box labelled &quot;Modem Messages&quot; appear.
 This is normal; the characters that appear are standard modem commands
and will be used by yourself and Sega customer service to determine if your
modem is dialing properly and connecting to your Internet Service Provider.
 Once connected, this box will disappear.</P>
<BR>
<P>On your first connection to the Internet, you will see a  simple instruction
page on how to use the Net Link web browser and Net Link City interface.
 Please review this page carefully; if you have questions after seeing this
page, please refer to the Net Link web browser manual.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><A NAME="what">Once You Have an Internet Account, Now What?</A></B></P>
<BR>
<P>Once you have set up your account, it's time to get on the Net!  To access
the Internet using the Net Link web browser, simply select a Link from
the Net Link web browser <A HREF="file://main.htm">Main Page</A> that will take you directly
to the Internet. The Net Link web browser will automatically dial up and
connect you to the Internet.  Clicking on your <A HREF="file://glossary.htm#E-mail">e-mail</A> (either the mail truck
or toolbar mail icon) will automatically connect you to the Internet as
well.  </P>
<BR>
<P>NOTE: If you want to connect to the Web without actually visiting a site,
you can choose the Connect Icon from the Toolbar, where you'll see the progress
of the connection, and be alerted to any connection problems that may arise.
 If you happen to have problems connecting to the Internet, please consult
the <A HREF="file://trouble.htm">Troubleshooting</A> section before calling Mplayer Internet Service Technical
Support at (415)429-3100.</P>
