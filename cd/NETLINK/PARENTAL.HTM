<BR>
<P>Since the World Wide Web contains much material that may not be suitable for all
ages, your Net Link web browser offers the ability to help "filter" what is seen so that
inappropriate material is not displayed.</P>
<BR>
<P>When you sign up for parental control, a default profile is created based on the given
age of the user.  If you wish, you can configure the parental controls to develop a "profile"
that includes your allowed ratings for 15 different rating categories.  This "profile" is saved
by PlanetWeb (the parental control provider) and the profile can only be changed using the
parental control password that you selected.  Even if your Sega Saturn's memory is erased, PlanetWeb
will still have your chosen profile and the same parental controls will still be in effect
after you reprogram your Sega Saturn and reconnect to the Internet.</P>
<BR>
<P>The same parental control settings will remain in effect until changed by someone who knows
the password you selected.  Keep this password confidential if you do not want the parental controls
changed without your knowledge.  <B>The parental control password is not needed for any other purpose.
It is not needed to connect to the Internet.</B></P>
<BR>
<P>If you are signing up with Mplayer Internet Service, you will be able to configure
parental controls during your initial sign-up.  Follow the simple on-screen instructions.</P>
<BR>
<P>If you are using a different Internet Service Provider, or if you want
to modify your initial settings,  you will need to connect to the Net Link
home page (click on the Sega Saturn &quot;What's New&quot; icon in the sky
above Net Link City) and click on the &quot;Parental Controls&quot; button.
 Follow the simple on-screen instructions.</P>
<BR>
<P>While PlanetWeb's Parental Control uses it's best efforts to protect your child,
no guarantee is provided or made that your child will not be able to see Web pages that
are not desirable.</P>
